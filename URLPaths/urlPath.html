    <h1>Understanding URLs nad Paths</h1>
    <p>The root of this directory structure is URLPaths. Inside this directory we have this file urlPath.html and another called contacts.html. Inside this root directory there are also two other directories -pdfs and projects- pdfs contains SolarSystem.pdf and projects index.html.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>A link to a file in the same directory</h2>
    <a href="contacts.html" target="_blank" class="link1">This link points to contacts.html. No further actions is needed since as it is in the same directory as the current file</a>
    <br>
    <h2>Moving down into subdirectory</h2>
    <p>Lets point to out index.html inside the projects directory. This is done by specifying the directory's name, then a forward slash, then the name of the file. so the URL you would use is projects/index.html</p>
    <a href="projects/index.html" target="_blank" class="link2">To "Our Solar System In A Nutshell"</a>
    <h2>Moving back up into parent directories</h2>
    <p>Inside the projects directory their is a link that goes from the index.html to the SolarSysttem.pdf inside the pdfs directory. You'd have to go up a directory level, then back down into the pdf directory. "Go up a directory" is indicated using two dots — .. — so the URL you would use is ../pdfs/SolarSystem.pdf</p>
